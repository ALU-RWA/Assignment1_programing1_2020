<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<p>Welcome to your first assignment <br>
This assignment is very easy and I just want to test a few things;</p>
<ol>
  <li>I want to make sure that you have your environment all set up</li>
  <li>I want to make sure that you can print strings on your screen and that you have
      a practice of writing your algorithm on paper before writing the code </li>
  <li>I want to make sure that you know how to accept an assignment on git ,
   clone a repository , work in that repository , commit your work and push it to git </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Letâ€™s play :)<br></p>

<h2>Question 1</h2>
<p>Write a program that prints your initials in big letters.<br>
For example my name is Ella Ty Karambizi<br>
My output should be :<br><br></p>

<pre>
    EEEEE      TTTTT      K     K
    E            T        K    K
    E            T        K   K
    E            T        K K
    EEEEE        T        K
    E            T        K K
    E            T        K  K
    E            T        K   K
    E            T        K    K
    EEEEE        T        K     K
    <br><br>
</pre>

<h2>Question 2</h2>
<p>In plain english and with the Given-required-algorithm table write a guessing
    game where the user has to guess a secret number. <br>After every guess the
    program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small.<br>
    At the end the number of tries needed should be printed.<br>
    It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.
</p>
